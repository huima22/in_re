Never again! Place was so dirty that I wound up not getting anything.  My daughter got a drink and the blender they used had residue on it from the previous drink.  That's after it was already rinsed.  Nasty!  Not one clean table either. 
For what they charge u for a coffee or cold drink.... You should be able to pay someone to keep the place clean.  I will stick to my dunks

review: Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta Airport is located South of Atlanta. There is reliable train that can take you North to Atlanta. We rented a car and arrived late afternoon and had to decide which freeway to take to end up in North Atlanta. We ended up taking the 285 on the West Side of Atlanta rather than the the State Road 400 Toll Road. I was later told that the Toll Road is never busy, but we arrived in less than 45 minutes anyway. 

If you have a layover in Atlanta, there is a Krystal Burger and several Starbucks at the Airport.

I received a job offer that required me to move to Atlanta, and having spent my whole life in California, moving to Georgia was a stressful and daunting task.  But my transition to Atlanta was a smooth one due in large part to Jeff's knowledge of Atlanta and his friendly, relaxed approach to working with clients.  If you're looking for an Atlanta Realtor, I'd definitely give Jeff at Best Atlanta Properties a call first.

review: The purpose of the Atlanta Streetcar is to be the latest, greatest status symbol for Downtown Atlanta as well as Atlanta's nearby hood.  It is also THE latest tourist attraction as well as a tool for turning potential visitors into possible Atlanta residents.  The Atlanta Streetcar fills a critical role in complementing MARTA as well helping people gain access to a piece of Downtown Atlanta as well as some most popular and important hotspots in town.  Easy access to the Skyview on Luckie St. as well as the CNN Center, Phillips Arena, the Georgia Dome, Underground Atlanta, Georgia State University, the MLK Center, Ebenezer Baptist Church, Grady Memorial Hospital, Sweet Auburn Market, the World of Coca Cola and many more.  The trains run around 15-20 minutes.  At times, the main pet peeve about the Atlanta Streetcar is that from time to time, the trains run out of service at the King Historic District, causing some people to wait for another train.  During peak hours the trains can get crowded.  The Atlanta Streetcar is perfect for bar hopping for those looking to avoid a DUI.  The Atlanta Streetcar also conects to the MARTA Peachtree station for those looking to go the further distance.  If you are able to find parking whether free or paid you can leave your car where it is and enjoy the convenience of the Atlanta Streetcar.  FYI the Atlanta Streetcar is free until 2016.

review: This venue at Atlantic Station has changed coffee shop locations several times since Atlantic Station opened. I remember it being a Cafe Nineteen, a PJ's coffee, and probably something else before that. Now it is a Land of a Thousand Hills, which I'm excited about! I think name recognition and the ideals of the company will keep it here. I am a huge fan of the Roswell location, but the Atlantic Station and Roswell locations are super different in atmospheres. The coffee consistency is the same and they both donate money and feature coffees from Rwanda. The baristas are all really knowledgeable. Their chemex is awesome! High-quality coffee! And the location is great, because it is right next to so many other things to do: movies, shopping, food, just hanging out around atlanta. PS: They also have beer.

review: I liken Atlantic Station to the 3rd St Promenade in Santa Monica, or Times Square in New York.  Both of which are places where if you are a local, you stay far and away from.    I go to Atlantic Station for a movie sometimes, and sometimes for a coffee.     Overall it is chain restaurant dining and chain stores.  The place lacks character.  On the weekends the place is a zoo.      After 2 hours it is $3 an hour for parking.   You kidding me???    Last I checked I was the customer.   And then all the spots and held aside for valet and VIP parking.  Give me a break.

I often use people's feeling on Atlantic Station as a determining factor as to how "in the know" they are in terms of Atlanta and what is going on.   If they rave that "Atlantic Station is great and I would love to live there" then everything they say is instantly discredited.      

Contrived.    Not my kind of scene, not my kind of crowd....

review: I start by saying that I am a fan of this place. The coffee and creativity is great! The location is also great next to the High Museum of Art and close to Atlantic Station but not at Atlantic Station. It is especially a great location if you're usually on-foot in Atlanta (as opposed to driving everywhere). They have some unique coffees or preparations of coffee such as the Kyoto Iced Coffee and the Coffee & Cigarettes affogato which I haven't tried yet, but has tobacco in it. The owners are awesome and friendly. I think they're still working on their food though. We got a couple of their buns: the fried chicken bun and the lamb belly button. Both of them were okay, but I feel like their not perfect yet. There was just something off about both. The meats were great, but I don't know if the sauce is what's causing it to be weird or something else. I also think the presentation is lacking. There is so much potential for creatively presenting their bento boxes, but they just serve them in paper boxes/ cardboard open boxes. I also didn't like the salad that the buns came with. So: Coffee - yes i'm a huge fan. Food: A-Ok.

review: Coffee? Delicious. Service? Excellent.

Wandering Atlantic Station on a Saturday evening and exhausted from a long day of walking, my date and I really needed a caffeine boost. The obvious choice was coffee. It is located across the street from the Regal Cinemas at Atlantic Station (more specifically across from Kinnucan's and next to Yogli Mogli).

Honestly, neither of us know a lot about coffee, so I cannot comment too much on the coffee beans or the brewing methods. But oh my gosh. Personally, I am pretty bad at discerning the quality of coffee (as long as it meets a certain standard), but I could taste the difference with the first sip of my cold brew. Same goes for my date and her regular coffee. Land of a Thousand Hills Coffee has some of the best coffee we have tried in Atlanta.

Let's talk about service. The employees really care about the quality and taste of the coffee. I ordered a regular hot coffee for my date while she was in the restroom. But when she returned, she explained that she had wanted a regular cold brew (not a regular hot coffee). It was obviously an error on our part. However, when she went to the counter to request a cup of ice to turn her coffee into a makeshift iced coffee, the employees explained that the regular coffee would not taste good over ice and insisted on giving her a cold brew free of charge. My date ended up with a complimentary nitro in addition to her original hot coffee. We tipped to make up for the difference before we left, but we really appreciated the amazing service.

They also have beer, food, and dessert options available for those who don't want coffee or want a small snack. I have yet to try anything other than the coffee, but I did notice that they had vegan dessert options for those with a vegan diet.

Parking is simple, because it is located at Atlantic Station. The first two hours of parking are free. There were a few people lounging around on their laptops, but there is a decent amount of seating (regular and bar seating).

I would highly recommend stopping by, especially if you're already wandering around Atlantic Station. I will definitely be visiting every time I'm shopping in the area.

review: One of few things that are European style in Atlantic Station. The cakes are not too sweet, as in Europe. Illy is my favorite coffee and there is no other coffee shop in Atlanta that has coffee as flavorful as here.

review: Great coffee. 
Great atmosphere.
The only store I go to at Atlantic Station. 

These guys are a breath of fresh air in Atlanta. Coffee that makes you smile and is prepared with care. No attitude because they've been in business years already without it.

review: This venue at Atlantic Station has changed coffee shop locations several times since Atlantic Station opened. I remember it being a Cafe Nineteen, a PJ's coffee, and probably something else before that. Now it is a Land of a Thousand Hills, which I'm excited about! I think name recognition and the ideals of the company will keep it here. I am a huge fan of the Roswell location, but the Atlantic Station and Roswell locations are super different in atmospheres. The coffee consistency is the same and they both donate money and feature coffees from Rwanda. The baristas are all really knowledgeable. Their chemex is awesome! High-quality coffee! And the location is great, because it is right next to so many other things to do: movies, shopping, food, just hanging out around atlanta. PS: They also have beer.

review: I liken Atlantic Station to the 3rd St Promenade in Santa Monica, or Times Square in New York.  Both of which are places where if you are a local, you stay far and away from.    I go to Atlantic Station for a movie sometimes, and sometimes for a coffee.     Overall it is chain restaurant dining and chain stores.  The place lacks character.  On the weekends the place is a zoo.      After 2 hours it is $3 an hour for parking.   You kidding me???    Last I checked I was the customer.   And then all the spots and held aside for valet and VIP parking.  Give me a break.

I often use people's feeling on Atlantic Station as a determining factor as to how "in the know" they are in terms of Atlanta and what is going on.   If they rave that "Atlantic Station is great and I would love to live there" then everything they say is instantly discredited.      

Contrived.    Not my kind of scene, not my kind of crowd....

review: I go to Atlanta a couple times a year and this is by far the best coffee place I know of in the area.  It is located in Atlantic Station and has a great atmosphere!  The lattes and fraps I had there are some of the best I have ever had.  I love coffee so that is saying something.  My favorite is the white chocolate/caramel mocha.  They recommended and I never stray because it is so good!  I have never had the food so I cant comment on that.

review: I start by saying that I am a fan of this place. The coffee and creativity is great! The location is also great next to the High Museum of Art and close to Atlantic Station but not at Atlantic Station. It is especially a great location if you're usually on-foot in Atlanta (as opposed to driving everywhere). They have some unique coffees or preparations of coffee such as the Kyoto Iced Coffee and the Coffee & Cigarettes affogato which I haven't tried yet, but has tobacco in it. The owners are awesome and friendly. I think they're still working on their food though. We got a couple of their buns: the fried chicken bun and the lamb belly button. Both of them were okay, but I feel like their not perfect yet. There was just something off about both. The meats were great, but I don't know if the sauce is what's causing it to be weird or something else. I also think the presentation is lacking. There is so much potential for creatively presenting their bento boxes, but they just serve them in paper boxes/ cardboard open boxes. I also didn't like the salad that the buns came with. So: Coffee - yes i'm a huge fan. Food: A-Ok.

Great Breakfast sandwiches in the morning and a fair lunch menu. Summer and spring are great spot to chill out side and people watch at noon . Service tend to be good during the day time. At night its a hit or miss!

review: Coffee? Delicious. Service? Excellent.

Wandering Atlantic Station on a Saturday evening and exhausted from a long day of walking, my date and I really needed a caffeine boost. The obvious choice was coffee. It is located across the street from the Regal Cinemas at Atlantic Station (more specifically across from Kinnucan's and next to Yogli Mogli).

Honestly, neither of us know a lot about coffee, so I cannot comment too much on the coffee beans or the brewing methods. But oh my gosh. Personally, I am pretty bad at discerning the quality of coffee (as long as it meets a certain standard), but I could taste the difference with the first sip of my cold brew. Same goes for my date and her regular coffee. Land of a Thousand Hills Coffee has some of the best coffee we have tried in Atlanta.

Let's talk about service. The employees really care about the quality and taste of the coffee. I ordered a regular hot coffee for my date while she was in the restroom. But when she returned, she explained that she had wanted a regular cold brew (not a regular hot coffee). It was obviously an error on our part. However, when she went to the counter to request a cup of ice to turn her coffee into a makeshift iced coffee, the employees explained that the regular coffee would not taste good over ice and insisted on giving her a cold brew free of charge. My date ended up with a complimentary nitro in addition to her original hot coffee. We tipped to make up for the difference before we left, but we really appreciated the amazing service.

review: My another favorite Vietnamese restaurant!

If you are looking for some quick and affordable food, go here!

Some say they have sanitary issues, but if you have decided to eat out, then the issue should be of no problem.

Many non vietnamese go there for a bowl of rice or for pho.

I recommend trying a bbq pork filled steamed bun as an appetizer.

And order pho of any types and bahn mi.
The soup is quite sweet, but it goes perfectly with bahn mi, which is a vietnamese sandwich. Bahn mi has chopped carrots, onions, slices of meat inside of soft yet crunchy baguette.

Strongly recommended :)

Although my bahn mi thit nuong was on the fatty side, I guess it added a lot of buttery flavor to the bahn mi!

And even though I said the Vietnamese dessert right (three color drink = Che Ba Mau, right?), I got something even better....a warm sweetened rice ball with a mung bean center in hot syrup!

review: I'm going to keep it short and sweet like the owner who runs this fine Vietnamese sandwich shop. Bahn Mi Nha Trang serves up by far the best bahn mi sandwich I have outside of saigon. The bahn mi sandwich comes on an eight inch fresh banquette with a number of choices for fillings ranging from Vietnamese pork, Vietnamese meatballs, veggies, roasted chicken, beef patty, and many more. The freshness of the bread alone is worth the trip to see Ms. Yen! Though she speaks minimal english, the owner is also super enthusiastic and friendly. My only complaint is the rising prices over the past few years, with sandwiches now around $4.00 even, which is definitely still a good deal. Whether craving a bahn mi or wanting to try something new without breaking the bank, Bahn Mi Nha Trang is worth the bookmark!

review: Pleasantly surprised with this jewel of an awesome seafood restaurant north of Boston in Burlington near the Burlington Mall. The decor and atmosphere was nice. Order a dozen oysters on half shell, lobster toe noodles, wife order the fish sandwich and kids had the Colorado Angus burgers. All cooked to perfection, tasty, delicious and fresh. Had several variety of oysters and the Island Creek oysters were the best. The waitstaff were awesome. Friendly, courteous, professional and attentive. Highly recommend the ICOB if you're looking for a great seafood restaurant in Burlington Massachusetts. Can't wait to comeback to the restaurant again...soon.

review: I just moved to Woburn and needed to fax some paper work on 1/18/14.  The business services people had an aura of attitude about them, they were rude and short with me during my visit.  I had to scan some files today (1/19/14, the next day) and I looked to see if there was another Staples nearby and there was one in Burlington so I went there today... The experience was night and day, my Burlington experience was nice, friendly, helpful, caring staff...

I will never step foot in the Woburn Staples ever again and Burlington will be the only Staples for me and my business :).

review: Burlington sure is becoming more entertaining! With the addition of Nordstrom Rack, Market Basket, and many more, H Mart is the king of all.

It is a Korean supermarket that is lively and delicious. Plenty of free samples on the weekend! (11am - 7:45pm) This gives non-elites a sense of the elite feeling (just mocking). So go on a weekend, skip lunch and gorge on the samples. It's a great way to add new items to your grocery list that you've never thought of before. If you're still not full, there is a cafeteria on the side with a great selection of food at affordable prices; Thai, Vietnamese, Korean and Japanese. There's even a bakery that bakes fresh breads and pastries. Yum!

Sure, you can go grocery shopping at Whole Foods or Stop and Shop, but H Mart is much more than that. It's an experience, and is one of the best things that ever happened to Burlington.

The food is always piping hot from anyone of these places.  I really like the Chix soup at Pho Chicken and the different choices at the Korean establishment.  The only downside is that it gets really busy there, and there a limited amount of seats and tables available.  Maybe H Mart should consider expanding the area, if they can.

review: I just moved to Colorado from Burlington, Vermont -where there is a large Vietnamese population and an abundance of tasty Vietnamese restaurants- and I was so pleased to discover the Double Happy!  The Vietnamese menu is Pho-nomenal.  Some of the tastiest (and definitely the biggest servings) of Pho that I've ever enjoyed.  Cheap for what you get, they always have special offers and they deliver.  It's become a staple for my family.  You won't be disappointed!

EDIT: 6/2/15
This place has really gone downhill.  Their food has become a bit inconsistent and they raised their prices.  The prices are not in line with what they offer now.  This place still has pretty good Pho, and it's awesome that you can add vegetables for $1...but that puts you at $13-14 for Pho.  :-/
I'm saddened, because I loved this place 2 years ago, but we don't eat here often anymore.  There are so many better places in Louisville with better food and lower prices.

I had the chicken pho, which was very good, just how I like it. We also got some sort of spring roll, which were also delicious. And I got a watermelon smoothie with boba, which was great and very refreshing.

review: When it rains, nothing cheers me up more than a nice hot bowl of Pho, a traditional favorite Vietnamese noodle soup. I'm spoiled by the many options in the Lowell area with so many local mom and pop shops but it's quite a different story near my work in Burlington, MA. I've been quite loyal to Pho 1 Woburn but sometimes the parking and wait just doesn't cut it.

In my attempt to find a back up plan, I did a Google search for "Pho Burlington, MA" and Cilantro Thai and Vietnamese popped up on my search results.  The restaurant took place of another South East Asian restaurant that also had an herb in its name, Green Basil about 9 months ago right in Woburn center.  If you get there early, you can get free street parking right in front of the restaurant.

The menu features a variety of Thai and Vietnamese dishes as well as a good selection of vegetarian entrees. I was here for the Pho! We were the only diners there and service was a bit slow.  The woman seemed occupied with the phones and takeout orders. (Later she explained that she had a large pick up order)

My coworker and I started off with a green tea bubble tea with pearls and a Thai iced tea, The drinks were served in cut glasses, the Thai tea in a mason jar mug.  Although the green shake was made with the powder mix, it was still good.


Since I had a hearty appetite that day (when do I not?) and it was only a dollar more, I opted for a large bowl of Tai Pho which has beef noodle soup with sliced rare eyeround.  I upgraded my bowl and added beef meatballs for only a buck more! That's cheaper than all the other places I've been to.  Keeping with traditions, the noodles were served with basil and (not so fresh) beansprouts.  My coworker tried to order the chicken pho but the server advised us that their freezer died on them and the broth went bad.  So, needles to say, their broth is NOT made fresh everyday.

The "large" size was the standard medium size of most Vietnamese restaurants in Lowell.

The noodles hit the spot. Although I prefer the noodle soups in the Lowell area, I have found a great substitute near work. I'd definitely be back to try the other menu items.

review: My husband travels a lot on business, and I often accompany him along with our baby boy. We've had spectacular Vietnamese food in the L.A. area, and wonderful variety in Falls Church, VA.

We stay in the Woburn/Burlington/Lexington area a few times a year when he's teaching for Sun, and Pho 1 has become one of our "no-brainer fallback" restaurants. Haven't tried any other Vietnamese places in the Boston area, so I don't know how it compares locally, but I consider it "above average" when it comes to mom & pop Vietnamese.

We always have trouble deciding what to order here - they have an extensive menu of Vietnamese and Thai dishes.

This review is based on our repeat experiences, but the details are from our most recent visit.

No salty limenade, which was disappointing, but had their "fresh limenade" last time, and it was lovely and indeed fresh. (My husband had bought an allegedly "not from concentrate" limeade from Target on Sunday that was the polar opposite of this one.)  I love lime drinks, so I started dinner happy. Convinced them to make a cafe sua da (Vietnamese iced coffee) with boba for my husband. Coffee was good, the bubbles were a little stiff/starchy this time.

Got a Vietnamese salad, but can't remember which one. nice blend of medium spicy flavors, though.

Ordered one of the Vietnamese rice combo plates (pork chop and shredded pork skin with a fried egg) - sorry, can't find the Viet name as it's not listed at their Web site. Good solid version thereof. The tamarind duck was really nice - not as emphatically tamarind as I'd have wanted, but a nice twist on sweet & sour chicken type dishes. The duck was tender, the breading wasn't oily, and the vegetables served underneath were crisp - snow peas, carrots, green beans, baby corn, broccoli, straw mushrooms, red bell peppers. (Nice assortment, too!) The shredded daikon and carrot on iceberg with cucumbers salad was dressed with a light hand, which I prefer.

Dunno how the service is in general. We tend to go late at night when the place is almost deserted, and thus have never had a problem. I've never tried their pho' - we're always too distracted by the other offerings. Not the cheapest place, but we've never been upset by the price, either.

review: My coworkers and I are regulars at Mr. Chan's Asian Bistro, located in the large plaza on Middlesex Turnpike in Burlington (also another located in Milton).  The waitresses know our preferences; chopsticks, hot chili oil and extra vegetables in lieu of the rice for my tall friend.  We've been coming here nearly every week for the past year whether its just my tall friend and I for lunch or a company luncheon with the whole inside sales department.

The restaurant is modern and tastefully decorated.  Seating is mostly comprised of small tables for two or four but they can accommodate larger parties in their semi private area or by the back wall.

The Asian Bistro offers a wide variety of options from Traditional Chinese menu offerings found in Chinatown, "American" Chinese food (You know, like pork fried rice and chicken fingers), as well as Thai, Japanese and Vietnamese staples.  Although I've tried almost everything on the menu, it never dawned on me to take photographs for my blog.  This post will feature mostly the "Chinese-American" dishes and I will update in the future. (I Promise!)

Their traditional Chinese dishes menu (only available in the Burlington location) features House Special Bird's Nest, Hainenese Chicken, Seafood in X.O. sauce, and other dishes like seafood and tofu casserole.  My favorite is the fried salt and pepper soft shell crab for $ 18.95.  When I  am feeling broke, I opt for the calamari.

Their fried salt and pepper calamari is just like the one served in Chinatown.

They have really good Japanese gyozas and shumais.  They are available steamed or pan fried.

review: I've been to Mr. Chan's in Burlington several times since the place opened, for lunch and dinner takeout only and been meaning to Yelp this place for quite some time.

This casual modern Asian restaurant serves up a good variety of traditional Chinese dishes plus a few Thai, Vietnamese and Japanese dishes too. The prices here seem reasonable, most dishes under $12. They offer 30 Lunch (until 3PM) and Dinner Specials which come with rice and choice of appetizer ($5.95-$9.95), dinner specials $1-$2 more than lunch specials.

I've ordered from the Specials (combinations) section for lunch and dinner including the No. 23 Shrimp Lo Mein and the No. 24 Jumbo Shrimp with Mixed Veggies, both  served with pork fried rice and appetizer choice. They also allow you to substitute soup instead of the appetizer. The portions of food served are plentiful. 

The Shrimp Lo Mein dish consists of mostly firm thin noodles with baby shrimp, carrots, onions, and scallion, which is on the salty side for taste. The Jumbo Shrimp with Mixed Veggies consists of tender jumbo shrimp (cleaned), snow peas, cabbage, carrots, onions, broccoli, and "preserved" mushroom slices, an A-OK dish. The pork fried rice is standard, which has a soft texture with roast pork pieces (some fat). The Chicken Teriyaki sticks are chargrilled/blackened on the outside, tender inside with a sweet and smoky flavor. The Hot & Sour Soup is quite good, which has a mixture of tofu, egg, bamboo, fungi, vegetables, and peppers in a medium spicy broth.

Overall, the food here has been good each time and the takeout service here is courteous and prompt.

I've been quite loyal to Pho 1 Woburn but sometimes the parking and wait just doesn't cut it.

In my attempt to find a back up plan, I did a Google search for "Pho Burlington, MA" and Cilantro Thai and Vietnamese popped up on my search results.  The restaurant took place of another South East Asian restaurant that also had an herb in its name, Green Basil about 9 months ago right in Woburn center.  If you get there early, you can get free street parking right in front of the restaurant.

The menu features a variety of Thai and Vietnamese dishes as well as a good selection of vegetarian entrees. I was here for the Pho! We were the only diners there and service was a bit slow.  The woman seemed occupied with the phones and takeout orders. (Later she explained that she had a large pick up order)

My coworker and I started off with a green tea bubble tea with pearls and a Thai iced tea, The drinks were served in cut glasses, the Thai tea in a mason jar mug.  Although the green shake was made with the powder mix, it was still good.


Since I had a hearty appetite that day (when do I not?) and it was only a dollar more, I opted for a large bowl of Tai Pho which has beef noodle soup with sliced rare eyeround.  I upgraded my bowl and added beef meatballs for only a buck more! That's cheaper than all the other places I've been to.  Keeping with traditions, the noodles were served with basil and (not so fresh) beansprouts.  My coworker tried to order the chicken pho but the server advised us that their freezer died on them and the broth went bad.  So, needles to say, their broth is NOT made fresh everyday.

The "large" size was the standard medium size of most Vietnamese restaurants in Lowell.

The noodles hit the spot. Although I prefer the noodle soups in the Lowell area, I have found a great substitute near work. I'd definitely be back to try the other menu items.

review: My husband travels a lot on business, and I often accompany him along with our baby boy. We've had spectacular Vietnamese food in the L.A. area, and wonderful variety in Falls Church, VA.

We stay in the Woburn/Burlington/Lexington area a few times a year when he's teaching for Sun, and Pho 1 has become one of our "no-brainer fallback" restaurants. Haven't tried any other Vietnamese places in the Boston area, so I don't know how it compares locally, but I consider it "above average" when it comes to mom & pop Vietnamese.

We always have trouble deciding what to order here - they have an extensive menu of Vietnamese and Thai dishes.

This review is based on our repeat experiences, but the details are from our most recent visit.

No salty limenade, which was disappointing, but had their "fresh limenade" last time, and it was lovely and indeed fresh. (My husband had bought an allegedly "not from concentrate" limeade from Target on Sunday that was the polar opposite of this one.)  I love lime drinks, so I started dinner happy. Convinced them to make a cafe sua da (Vietnamese iced coffee) with boba for my husband. Coffee was good, the bubbles were a little stiff/starchy this time.

Got a Vietnamese salad, but can't remember which one. nice blend of medium spicy flavors, though.

Ordered one of the Vietnamese rice combo plates (pork chop and shredded pork skin with a fried egg) - sorry, can't find the Viet name as it's not listed at their Web site. Good solid version thereof. The tamarind duck was really nice - not as emphatically tamarind as I'd have wanted, but a nice twist on sweet & sour chicken type dishes. The duck was tender, the breading wasn't oily, and the vegetables served underneath were crisp - snow peas, carrots, green beans, baby corn, broccoli, straw mushrooms, red bell peppers. (Nice assortment, too!) The shredded daikon and carrot on iceberg with cucumbers salad was dressed with a light hand, which I prefer.

Dunno how the service is in general. We tend to go late at night when the place is almost deserted, and thus have never had a problem. I've never tried their pho' - we're always too distracted by the other offerings. Not the cheapest place, but we've never been upset by the price, either.

review: My coworkers and I are regulars at Mr. Chan's Asian Bistro, located in the large plaza on Middlesex Turnpike in Burlington (also another located in Milton).  The waitresses know our preferences; chopsticks, hot chili oil and extra vegetables in lieu of the rice for my tall friend.  We've been coming here nearly every week for the past year whether its just my tall friend and I for lunch or a company luncheon with the whole inside sales department.

The restaurant is modern and tastefully decorated.  Seating is mostly comprised of small tables for two or four but they can accommodate larger parties in their semi private area or by the back wall.

The Asian Bistro offers a wide variety of options from Traditional Chinese menu offerings found in Chinatown, "American" Chinese food (You know, like pork fried rice and chicken fingers), as well as Thai, Japanese and Vietnamese staples.  Although I've tried almost everything on the menu, it never dawned on me to take photographs for my blog.  This post will feature mostly the "Chinese-American" dishes and I will update in the future. (I Promise!)

Their traditional Chinese dishes menu (only available in the Burlington location) features House Special Bird's Nest, Hainenese Chicken, Seafood in X.O. sauce, and other dishes like seafood and tofu casserole.  My favorite is the fried salt and pepper soft shell crab for $ 18.95.  When I  am feeling broke, I opt for the calamari.

Their fried salt and pepper calamari is just like the one served in Chinatown.

They have really good Japanese gyozas and shumais.  They are available steamed or pan fried.

review: I've been to Mr. Chan's in Burlington several times since the place opened, for lunch and dinner takeout only and been meaning to Yelp this place for quite some time.

This casual modern Asian restaurant serves up a good variety of traditional Chinese dishes plus a few Thai, Vietnamese and Japanese dishes too. The prices here seem reasonable, most dishes under $12. They offer 30 Lunch (until 3PM) and Dinner Specials which come with rice and choice of appetizer ($5.95-$9.95), dinner specials $1-$2 more than lunch specials.

I've ordered from the Specials (combinations) section for lunch and dinner including the No. 23 Shrimp Lo Mein and the No. 24 Jumbo Shrimp with Mixed Veggies, both  served with pork fried rice and appetizer choice. They also allow you to substitute soup instead of the appetizer. The portions of food served are plentiful. 

The Shrimp Lo Mein dish consists of mostly firm thin noodles with baby shrimp, carrots, onions, and scallion, which is on the salty side for taste. The Jumbo Shrimp with Mixed Veggies consists of tender jumbo shrimp (cleaned), snow peas, cabbage, carrots, onions, broccoli, and "preserved" mushroom slices, an A-OK dish. The pork fried rice is standard, which has a soft texture with roast pork pieces (some fat). The Chicken Teriyaki sticks are chargrilled/blackened on the outside, tender inside with a sweet and smoky flavor. The Hot & Sour Soup is quite good, which has a mixture of tofu, egg, bamboo, fungi, vegetables, and peppers in a medium spicy broth.

Overall, the food here has been good each time and the takeout service here is courteous and prompt.

The place smells like vomit/cleaner, it's dirty, and the food isn't good.  Drinks are completely average but expensive and the food is just eh.  I'm NOT picky about the quality of the restaurant as long as it's good and I really dislike this place (and so do most of my friends I've been with, who also are not picky).

review: I LOVE this dog park! I just wish it wasn't so far away! 

There's a great area for the little dogs and so far there has been lots of little dogs there every time we've gone. I love that there is a water source in each section of the park so the dogs never go thirsty. The small dog area is pretty well maintained, I haven't come across any little packages left behind by other dogs, so the owners do well with cleaning up after their pets. The one bad thing about the small dog area is that there is no shade! There are some trees at the very far end of the fenced in area, but they don't give much shade. And there is one small tree inside the small dog area, but you can't stand in it's shade because it is so small (only good to shade the dogs). 

I do have one thing about this park that really made me really angry, but it's not really the park, it was the people. I took my dog there once this spring and there wasn't any other small dogs there, which wasn't a problem cause my dog still loves to run even by herself. The problem was that ALL the big dogs were using the small dog area because the big dog area was a little muddy. So we tried to use the big dog area instead, but there was so much dog poop over there is was absolutely disgusting! The big dog owners obviously do not pick up after their dogs and that is some huge poop! My dog couldn't run in the areas where it wasn't muddy because it was covered in poop so we had to leave and drive 20 minutes to another dog park. When we came back a couple days later, the big dogs had almost ruined the small dog area, making it extremely muddy and left huge dog poop everywhere. 
Big dogs need to stay in their area and leave the small area to the little dogs. 

Also, a pet peeve of mine is people who bring their young kids to the dog park. A dog park is no where to bring your young kids! Especially when they harass the dogs. My dog is scared of kids now because some kid picked her up and threw her on the ground because some parent wasn't watching their kid. If you want to exercise your dog and include your kids, take them on a walk, not to the dog park.

review: Having only shot clays a few times I was a little aprehensive when my friends wanted to go here.  It was another friend's birthday party so I felt a bit obligated.

What a 'blast' it was.  Only a few dollars for a round and $7/box of shells.  Everythign was automatic and the range kid, Alex, was super friendly and helpful.

It was a fun way to spend a cold sunny afternoon in Portland.

review: Quick delivery! Make sure to stress if u r vegetarian, and specify what u do and don't eat. I ordered soups and went by the veggie icons on menu, but when it arrived it had chicken, shrimp and who knows what else, was yummy though ;). Seafood Laksa was good too. Fresh and plentiful and CHEAP!

review: An excellent local establishment , filled with regulars but completely welcoming to newcomers. Burgers are great, as is the seafood, and chicken sandwiches. 

As others have noted, it fills up quickly on the weekends, and on a Friday night if you show up after 6ish there is usually a bit of a wait for a table, though they have a great bar and the game is always on while you wait.

The staff is terrific, and owner Karl is a great host, and a welcome throwback to the days when restaurant owners knew your name, and depending on the night, might just sit down to join you for a beer.

All in all a down to earth and friendly joint with great food and drink.

  For two people, we ate like kings for ~$25/person for dinner
   I'd also note that if you come here only for the dumplings (and a lot of people seem to), you'll end up over paying ($7.50 for 8 Dumpling with minced pork for example), compared to speciality mom and pop dumpling places around the area - I didn't think the SR dumplings were that much better
 Most of the food was yummy
  Service was very pleasant as always! Food are like heaven with a not expensive at all price! Will definitely recommend if you've had enough of the Yue style dimsum!The dumplings were above average
  We waited for over 10 min and finally a young waiter came took our order
  Advice: go with a bunch of friends, order a lot of food, and figure out for yourself what you really like
  The shui zhu yang is not flavorful or good
